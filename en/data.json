Speaking at the event, Javid Abdullayev, Director of the State Agency for Renewable Energy Sources, spoke about our country's contributions to global efforts in the fight against climate change and reducing carbon emissions. President Ilham Aliyev drew attention to the mega projects implemented in accordance with the state policy that prioritizes the development of the use of renewable energy, and said that with the commissioning of the Garadag Solar Power Station, the production of solar energy increased more than 8 times in 6 months: 95 kW of the project is installed in water, 5 kW of it is installed on land. annual production of more than 160,000 kWh of electricity is predicted through The project serves as a call for attracting private investments, and discussions on its expansion have already started ","image": "../assets/news/7.jpg"

        "text": "Trees reveal climate surprise: Microbes living in bark remove methane from the atmosphere. Tree bark surfaces play an important role in removing methane gas from the atmosphere, according to a study published 24 July in Nature. While trees have long been known to benefit the climate by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, this new research reveals a surprising additional climate benefit. Microbes hidden within tree bark can absorb methane—a powerful greenhouse gas—from the atmosphere. An international team of researchers led by the University of Birmingham has shown for the first time that microbes living in bark or in the wood itself are removing atmospheric methane on a scale equal to or above that of soil. They calculate that this newly discovered process makes trees 10% more beneficial for climate overall than previously thought.The Global Methane Pledge, launched in 2021 at the COP26 climate change summit aims to cut methane emissions by 30% by the end of the decade. Our results suggest that planting more trees and reducing deforestation surely must be important parts of any approach towards this goal.",

        "text": "The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern history, claiming over 230,000 lives across 14 countries. The catastrophe highlighted critical gaps in early warning systems, emergency preparedness, and disaster response. In its aftermath, significant efforts were made to strengthen global disaster resilience, particularly in coastal communities. One of the most crucial outcomes was the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (IOTWMS), which has improved regional coordination and real-time alerts. Advances in technology, including seismic monitoring and deep-sea pressure sensors, have enhanced early warning capabilities. Furthermore, many countries have integrated disaster risk reduction into national policies, improving evacuation planning, infrastructure resilience, and public awareness campaigns. Despite these advancements, challenges remain. Rapid urbanization, climate change, and environmental degradation heighten disaster risks. The 2004 tsunami is a powerful reminder of the need for sustained investment in resilience building, community education, and international cooperation. By learning from past tragedies, we can create a safer and more prepared world for future generations.",
